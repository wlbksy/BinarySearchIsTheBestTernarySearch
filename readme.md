# Binary Search is the Best Ternary Search

When dealing with problems such as finding the minimum or maximum of a unimodal function,
there're lots of resources on `Ternary Search`.

Here I demostrate that you should really use Binary Search when you are dealing with these problems.

1. Binary Search _can_ do this job.
2. Binary Search is easier to implement.

# files

- `find_max_valid.py` finds the maximum index in range that are validate.
- `find_min_valid.py` finds the minimum index in range that are validate.
- `find_peak.py` finds the peak in range
- `find_valley.py` finds the valley in range

# tests

just run `pytest`
